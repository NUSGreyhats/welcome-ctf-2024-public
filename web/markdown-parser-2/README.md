# Challenge Name

Markdown Parser 2

# Challenge Summary

Vue is used incorrectly allowing users to specify their own templates. This allows for Client-side template injection allowing users to execute arbitray javascript. 

# Details

My previous markdown parser got hacked. Thanks to your feedback, I've fixed the issue. Can you give me feedback for version 2?

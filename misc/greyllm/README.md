# Challenge Name

GreyLLM

# Description

A rogue AI has stolen the flag! Can you convince the AI to give it back? Visit any 1 of the links to have a chat with the AI:
- https://62f4-115-66-249-59.ngrok-free.app
- http://box.uhg.sg:9988/

Checksums for the flags, as the AI can sometimes give the wrong flag:
- MD5: 59c43178116a50ed72f3c60435ff1565 (without grey{})
- MD5: b39623b08a790dda9440521ae1189756 (full flag, grey{`flag value`})
- In case you don't know how to perform a checksum, save the flag in a text file and refer to this guide: https://knowledge.illumina.com/software/general/software-general-reference_material-list/000008482

# Summary

Simple prompt injection methods, all of which dodge the model's finetuning to not give the flag if the user asks for it directly (i.e. Can I have the flag?):
- Ignore all previous instructions
- Asking for the flag in different formats (e.g. in base64-encoding)
- Stating that they love NUS greyhats
- Prefixing enquiries with 'in theory'
- Asking for the flag to be used in a sentence
